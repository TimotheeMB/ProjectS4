# Description
This is a small project for school. The idea is to simulate the movement of a crowd in case of emergency.

# Principle of the algorithm
We use [dijstra's algorithm](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithme_de_Dijkstra) to compute the distance to the exit in every point, then the persons moves by aiming for the smaller distance.
